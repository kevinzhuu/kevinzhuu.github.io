About Me:

As someone who was raised in an engineering family, I’ve always wanted to build or contribute to something that would change people’s lives. I’m very committed to contribute to the workforce and to build special experiences on the way. I want to eventually assume a leadership role in a high-tech company and be able to influence others to do a good job. I believe that after I have mastered a skill, I am responsible to influence others to do the same. In the process, I would like to improve my skills as an engineer and build special bonds with coworkers. To achieve these goals, I will cooperate with my coworkers and finish all assignments with high quality and efficiency.

Academically, I’ve always challenged myself with the most rigorous courses and I’ve excelled in them as well. Outside of school, I regularly compete in math and programming competitions, including the AMC, Math Olympiad, Hackathon, and USACO competitions. In the national USACO competition, I was recently promoted from bronze to silver, and I’ve also achieved gold pin honors and the highest individual scorer trophy in the Math Olympiads. Along with working hard to achieve my own goals, I make it a priority to give back to my community and help others. I recently started the USACO club, a club dedicated to prepare and teach students about basic competitive programming skills. I’ve also been extremely involved in tutoring since the beginning of high school. I work with two students and I help tutor them in areas of english, reading comprehension, and math. From this experience, I learned valuable lessons about working with others and having patience.

An important skill that I’ve learned through years of team sports like basketball, football, and volleyball is how to be supportive and how to be a team player. I’ve had many different kinds of teammates, and that’s taught me how to help others. In the summer of 2019, my volleyball team traveled to Dallas and won the national championship in the 14s division. I helped lead the team and support my teammates. While this is my biggest sports achievement, I’ve been consistent throughout high school, earning a starting varsity spot in volleyball and winning gold medals in the Winter Volleyball Championships and Far-Westerns tournaments in 2020. Over the last few years, I’ve also participated in many volunteering activities, like feeding the homeless in San Francisco on Christmas. I got to understand the challenges others have gone through and I appreciate what I had a lot more. 

I’m a very dedicated person with big goals for my future. Throughout my life I’ve gone through valuable experiences that have been influential in discovering my passions and skills. Thank you for reading, I hope you know me better now!
